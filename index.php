        <a>Summer Capital of the&nbspPhilippines</a>
        <p>Baguio is the top destination to go to if you want to take a break from the tropical heat in the lowlands. With average temperatures ranging from 15-23°C(59-73°F), the city rarely experiences temperatures higher than 26°C(78.8°F) even during the warmest parts of the year. Because of this climate, Baguio is also home to beautiful plants that wouldn’t usually survive elsewhere in the county. Also nicknamed the City of Pines, you’ll be in for a treat with all the beautiful flowers and lush vegetation as you enter the vicinity. It will truly feel as if you’re entering a different world.
