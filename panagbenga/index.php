                <p>The highlands of Baguio City in the Philippines has been known as the country’s Summer Capital. That’s why people make the long road trip to Baguio from Manila to escape the stifling heat of the lowlands and polluted cities in the metro. Another reason tourists travel to the City of Pines is the Baguio Flower Festival or Panagbenga Festival. It is an annual flower festival in Baguio celebrated every February.
