    <!---------- Stone Kingdom ---------->
    <div class="text">
        <a>Igorot Stone Kingdom</a>
        <p>Baguio City Igorot Stone Kingdom is the newest tourist attraction in the City of Pines. Tucked away from the central business district is a man-made park made out of stone which was based on a fantasy kingdom and the rich cultural heritage of Igorots and the different provinces here in the Cordilleras.
        </p>
        <p>The Stone Kingdom, located at 362 Longlong Road, Pinsao Proper, is just a stone’s throw away from another famous tourist spot in Baguio City- the Tam-Awan Village.
            From the main road of Longlong, you wouldn’t expect there is a stone castle just a few walks away. You know you’ve reached the destination through a sign along the road just after passing Tam-Awan Village.

        <a>Maryknoll Ecological Sanctuary</a>
        <p>The Maryknoll Ecological Sanctuary takes visitors on a journey on the evolution of the universe in 14 stations in a serene garden.
        </p>
        <p>After the 1990 earthquake that hit Baguio City, the Maryknoll Sisters decided on an alternative way to use their resources in the City of Pines and converted their elementary school as a venue for education still, but this time to focus on the fragile environment that is the planet Earth.
        </p>
        <p>Thus they created a serene environment where folks can go on a peaceful stroll, a secret garden of sorts that offers peace and serenity in the middle of a bustling city.
